# LUX BOT
This is just a silly Discord bot I'll work on in my spare time. No, you can't add it to your server, but you can clone my code!

## Current Commands (~):
- add (Adds all the numbers listed after the head)
- insult (Throws a random insult)
- cleanchat (*WIP*)
- figlet (Given a string, it returns ASCII art) 
- dtob (Coverts decimal to binary (8b max))
- btod (Converts binary to decimal)
